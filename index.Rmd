We will capitalize on the excellent clinical data in Scotland by making it available to all six tumour themes with an aspiration to set up mechanisms to provide data to researchers in other cancer types. Our data allows rich clinical phenotyping, clinical pathway analysis and outcome measurement spanning the whole cancer journey from screening and diagnosis to treatment, survivorship and end of life care. Clinical annotation is inherent as a complement to molecular data and research datasets. Clinical, and any accompanying molecular, data fundamentally underlying aspects of the Centreâ€™s work by allowing a stratified approach; by prior risk of disease or cancer subtype, for example, allowing the identification of high-risk patients for optimisation of screening, surveillance, investigation and treatment. Mechanistic insights into disease will be generated from pre-clinical in vitro/in vivo model systems that can provide a detailed understanding of disease aetiology. The data theme will also support the generation and integrated analysis of pre-clinical and patient-derived multiomics datasets, leading to mechanistic insights and target identification. Data is also essential for evaluating the clinical value and health service impact of new technologies and medicines emerging from our research programme; and for the identification of patients for translational research and clinical trials.
