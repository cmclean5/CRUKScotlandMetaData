In Scotland, approximately 55,000 cancer registrations are made annually. The Scottish Cancer Registry database holds over 1,800,000 records dating back to 1958, when the registry began.\nCancer registries are unique in being able to provide historical trend and population-based data to monitor changes in cancer incidence and survival over long periods of time. Cancer registries across the world share the same main objective: to deliver timely, comparable and high-quality cancer data.\nThe Scottish Cancer Registry contains information on all new cases of cancer including primary malignant neoplasms, carcinoma in situ, neoplasms of uncertain behaviour and benign brain and spinal cord tumours.\nThe data is in flat .dat file format and a file layout is needed in order to determine the location of each variable. Please note that the file layout can change over time so ensure that the correct file layout version is used.\nData Quirks\nICDO Codes\nInternational classification of diseases for oncology (ICD-O) codes are recorded in SMR06 with codes for both morphology and site.\nTumour type indicates the morphology (histology) of the tumour and comprises of the first four digits of the ICD-O morphology code and a fifth digit which denotes the behaviour of the tumour.\n\n\nTable 1: \n\n\nCode\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n0\n\n\nBenign\n\n\n1\n\n\nUncertain whether benign or malignant\n\n\n2\n\n\nCarcinoma in situ\n\n\n3\n\n\nMalignant - primary site\n\n\n6\n\n\nMalignant - metastatic site or secondary site\n\n\n9\n\n\nMalignant - uncertain whether primary or metastatic site\n\n\nDiagnosis on the same day\nIt is possible for patients to be diagnosed with multiple primary tumours on the same day; this must be accounted for when looking at patient history as these tumours can potentially be flagged as tumour history.\nNon Lothian Residents\nOn average 36% of patients in SMR06 each year are non-Lothian residents. These patients have been removed from the analysis as the data for their full history lies with the health board of residence which at the moment there is no access to.\nTo see a breakdown by treatment type please see the summary table.\nFor access please contact Analytical Services or NHS Lothian Research Safe Haven\n\n\nOncology Database\n\n\nAdd Text\n\n\nCHI files\n\n\nAdd Text\n\n\nChemocase (SACT)\n\n\nAdd Text\n\n\nSCAN Audit\n\n\nAdd Text\n\n\nPrescribing Information System (PIS)\n\n\nAdd Text\n\n\n\n\n",
