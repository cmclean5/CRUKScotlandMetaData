      "contents": "\nIntroduction\n\nThere are a large number of databases containing information that can potentially be used to improve the care of individuals with, or at risk of, colorectal cancer. The Bowel Cancer Intelligence programme is creating the Colorectal Repository (CORECT-R) for research purposes. At present, CORECT-R contains mainly English data sets. However, it is hoped that going forward, Scottish data will be added. In the meantime, the CORECT-R Scotland project is hosting a Scottish data extract within the National Safe Haven that contains information on colorectal cancer-diagnosed patients (PBPP project number: 1718-0026). In short, the Scottish CORECT-R brings together cancer registry data with other routinely collected data, including detailed chemotherapy prescribing data, which has not historically been linked at a national level. For further information on the Scottish CORECT-R project, including details on the PBPP application and research questions, please visit the Edinburgh Health Economics site.\nThe datasets that are currently included in the Scottish CORECT-R are described below:\n\nDemographics\nSeveral pieces of demographic information is also available for patients in the CORECT-R Scotland.\nNational Records of Scotland Deaths\nScottish Morbidity Records\nNational Cancer Audit (QPI)\nChemocase (SACT)\nPrescribing Information System (PIS)\nPatient Level Costs\nCritial Care\nUnscheduled Care\n\n\n\n",

In Scotland, approximately 55,000 cancer registrations are made annually. The Scottish Cancer Registry database holds over 1,800,000 records dating back to 1958, when the registry began.\nCancer registries are unique in being able to provide historical trend and population-based data to monitor changes in cancer incidence and survival over long periods of time. Cancer registries across the world share the same main objective: to deliver timely, comparable and high-quality cancer data.\nThe Scottish Cancer Registry contains information on all new cases of cancer including primary malignant neoplasms, carcinoma in situ, neoplasms of uncertain behaviour and benign brain and spinal cord tumours.\nThe data is in flat .dat file format and a file layout is needed in order to determine the location of each variable. Please note that the file layout can change over time so ensure that the correct file layout version is used.\nData Quirks\nICDO Codes\nInternational classification of diseases for oncology (ICD-O) codes are recorded in SMR06 with codes for both morphology and site.\nTumour type indicates the morphology (histology) of the tumour and comprises of the first four digits of the ICD-O morphology code and a fifth digit which denotes the behaviour of the tumour.\n\n\nTable 1: \n\n\nCode\n\n\nDescription\n\n\n0\n\n\nBenign\n\n\n1\n\n\nUncertain whether benign or malignant\n\n\n2\n\n\nCarcinoma in situ\n\n\n3\n\n\nMalignant - primary site\n\n\n6\n\n\nMalignant - metastatic site or secondary site\n\n\n9\n\n\nMalignant - uncertain whether primary or metastatic site\n\n\nDiagnosis on the same day\nIt is possible for patients to be diagnosed with multiple primary tumours on the same day; this must be accounted for when looking at patient history as these tumours can potentially be flagged as tumour history.\nNon Lothian Residents\nOn average 36% of patients in SMR06 each year are non-Lothian residents. These patients have been removed from the analysis as the data for their full history lies with the health board of residence which at the moment there is no access to.\nTo see a breakdown by treatment type please see the summary table.\nFor access please contact Analytical Services or NHS Lothian Research Safe Haven\n\n\nOncology Database\n\n\nAdd Text\n\n\nCHI files\n\n\nAdd Text\n\n\nChemocase (SACT)\n\n\nAdd Text\n\n\nSCAN Audit\n\n\nAdd Text\n\n\nPrescribing Information System (PIS)\n\n\nAdd Text\n\n\n\n\n",

Our data allows rich clinical phenotyping, clinical pathway analysis and outcome measurement spanning the whole cancer journey from screening and diagnosis to treatment, survivorship and end of life care. Clinical annotation is inherent as a complement to molecular data and research datasets. Clinical, and any accompanying molecular, data fundamentally underlying aspects of the Centre’s work by allowing a stratified approach; by prior risk of disease or cancer subtype, for example, allowing the identification of high-risk patients for optimisation of screening, surveillance, investigation and treatment. Mechanistic insights into disease will be generated from pre-clinical in vitro/in vivo model systems that can provide a detailed understanding of disease aetiology. The data theme will also support the generation and integrated analysis of pre-clinical and patient-derived multiomics datasets, leading to mechanistic insights and target identification. Data is also essential for evaluating the clinical value and health service impact of new technologies and medicines emerging from our research programme; and for the identification of patients for translational research and clinical trials.\n\n\n\n\n",
